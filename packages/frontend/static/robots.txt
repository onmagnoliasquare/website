# The `www` subdomain is being used here, make sure that this redirects
# 301 to the apex, onmagnoliasquare.com. This redirect is a page rule,
# and the `www` is a DNS record.
#
# `www` is used because it accounts for both the apex and sub domain.
# If just the apex domain were used, it would not account for the
# subdomain `www`.
